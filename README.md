This is an indie open-world RPG game developed by my sister and me.
It's created using Unreal Engine 5. 
  
  
The world is endless and auto-generated. It has 3 different biomes. Most of its objects are 2D but pretend to be 3D. You can also see their shadows don't rotate while the objects face the rotating camera.

The game has mechanics for fighting, crafting and researching, as well as capturing animals. There is some variety of creatures (both peaceful
and hostile), soon there will be more videos with their interaction.

The fight starts automatically as soon as you get close enough to the enemy. Each creature has its own attack range, attack spread, and attack speed. Each creature in the area (puddle) is hit, allowing multiple targets to be hit at the same time. After being hit you are immune for a short time.

The inventory/drop system is simple, you can stack or split items you have, or those you can reach on the ground, or those in any other storrage, no matter where they are.
